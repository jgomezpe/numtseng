        Welcome to Numtseng, the online school of professor Jonatan Gómez where you can learn about mathematics, computing, and other topics.
        <br><br>
        Content is organized as an enciclopedya: books, chapters, sections, and sessions. You can navigate them by using the table of content located at 
        the left part of the webpage (initially hiden in small size screens) or by using the navigation buttons in the bar:
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-left'></i> To go to the previous sister content (previous content at the same level).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up'></i> To go to the parents content (level containing the unit).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-down'></i> To go to the first child content (first content developed by the unit).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right'></i> To go to the next sister content (next content at the same level).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-sort-amount-asc'></i> To change the explanation depth level that we will provide to you (basic, medium, or advanced).
        <br><br>
        You can also change the language by using the <i class='fa fa-language'></i> button (we just support Spanish and English for the time being).
        <br><br>
        You will be able to follow the content as a dynamic presentation, if a play button <i class='fa fa-language'></i> 
        appears at the left-top part of the web page.
