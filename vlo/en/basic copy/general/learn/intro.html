        Many of the happy moments we have in life are those when we learn something, for example:
        <ul>
            <li>When we learn to walk, to ride a bike, or to drive a car.</li>
            <li>When we learn to paint, to play a musical instrument, or to practice some sport.</li>
            <li>When we learn a language and can use it comunicate our ideas.</li>
            <li>When we learn new methods for solving our problems.</li>
        </ul> 
        <br>
        Learn, allows us to adquire konwledge about things around us and to gain hability in activities we can carry on. 
        When we learn, such knowledge and habilities are <i>internalized</i>, that means,  those become part of us. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For learning, we must be ready to: 
        <ul>
            <li><b>Study:</b> Pay attention, in a very detail and interested fashion, to 'things' that are present in our reality.</li>
            <li><b>Experience:</b> Interact with our reality, be ready to try, to make mistakes, to correct ourselves, to try as many times until we make it.</li>
            <li><b>Be guided:</b> Allow people that already learnt to share their expiriences and travel along us the path we want to walk.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
    </div>
</body>
