        Welcome to Numtseng, the online school of professor Jonatan Gómez for learning about mathematics, programming, and other topics.
        <br><br>
        Content is organized as a book: chapters, sections, subsections, and sessions, all these can be navigated by using the table of content located at 
        the left of the webpage (initially hiden in small size screens) or by using the navigation buttons in the bar:
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-left'></i> To go to the previous sister content (previous content at the same level).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-up'></i> To go to the parents content (level containing the unit).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-down'></i> To go to the first child content (first content developed by the unit).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-circle-o-right'></i> To go to the next sister content (next content at the same level).
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-language'></i> To select the language used by the web browser (actually we just support Spanish and English).
        <br><br>
        Finally, a hypermedia component, located at the left-top part of the web page, will allow you to follow the content as a dynamic presentation.
