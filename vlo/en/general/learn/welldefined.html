        While we are learning, it is possible to find things that are <b>well defined</b>, that means, 
        we will be able to say what they are in a precise manner, but sometimes we will find things that are not well defined or may be we can only
        say what can we do with them or what those things can do. We will call <b>fundamental</b> things to things that are not well defined
        while we will call <b>derivate</b> things to those things that are well defined, regardless if such definition considers fundamental things.
        <br><br> 
        Sometimes, with the idea of making more simple our learning process, we propose <b>naive</b> definition for fundamental things. Such naive 
        definitions take in consideration our intuitive understanding about things.
