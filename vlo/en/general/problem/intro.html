        We hava a <b>problem</b> when we wish to find or describe an object (we will call it <b>unknown object</b>) from a
        group of objects (called <b>known objects</b>) and a relation that the unknown object maintains with the known objects.
        <br><br>
        To <b>solve</b> a problem we must:
        <ul>
            <li>Characterize the known objects in a precise manner, that means, we need to anwer the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>¿Which are the types of the known objects?</li>
                    <li>¿What are the values such known objects can take?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Characterize the unknown object in a precise manner, that means, we need to anwer the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>¿Which is the type of the unknown object?</li>
                    <li>¿What are the values such unknown object can take?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Answer, in a precise manner, ¿How are related the known objects to the unknown object?</li>
        </ul>
