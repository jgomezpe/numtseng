        We have a <b>problem</b> when we wish to find an object (called it <b>unknown object</b>) from a
        group of objects (called <b>known objects</b>) and a relation that the unknown object maintains with the known objects.
        <br><br>
        <b>Solving</b> a problem is to find the unknown object. In Numtseng, instead of just solving problems, we will learn a 
        process to solve problems. To solve a problem we must:
        <ul>
            <li>Characterize the known objects in a precise manner, that means, we must answer the following question: 
                ¿What are the known objects?. For doing this, we need to anwer the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>¿Which are the types of the known objects?</li>
                    <li>¿What are the values such known objects can take?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Characterize the unknown object in a precise manner, that means, we need to anwer the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>¿Which is the type of the unknown object?</li>
                    <li>¿What are the values such unknown object can take?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Answer, in a precise manner, ¿How are related the known objects to the unknown object?</li>
        </ul>
