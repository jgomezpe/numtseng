        <br><br>
        Content is organized as an encyclopedia: books, chapters, sections, and sessions. You can navigate them by using the table of content located at 
        the left part of the webpage (initially hiden in small size screens) or by using the navigation buttons in the bar:
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-left'></i> To go to the previous content.
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-arrow-right'></i> To go to the next content.
        <br><br>
        <i class='fa fa-sort-amount-asc'></i> To change the explanation depth level that we will provide to you (basic, medium, or advanced).
        <br><br>
        You can also change the language by using the <i class='fa fa-language'></i> button (we just support Spanish and English for the time being).
        <br><br>
        You will be able to follow the content as a dynamic presentation, if a play button <i class='fa fa-play'></i> 
        appears at the left-top part of the web page.
